We're moving! We would like to thank trialfire.com for paying our meetup.com bills for the whopping year! Now when we have so many ideas and initiatives, we're ready to become chefs of our own destiny :) 

What does all this mean?

* What once was [http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Scala-Typesafe-User-Group](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Scala-Typesafe-User-Group) will remain to be owned by trialfire.com. 
	* When we gently wanted to take over and tried to remind them that we organized and grew this community longer before merging our meetup group with theirs (meetup.com discontiuned the free community page feature), trialfire.com insisted that it is valuable marketing tool for them. 
	* Our advise: don't try to save 20$ a month on something so important as a community that you're building :)

* Who used to actually organize meetups (aka Katrin Shechtman and Sean Glover) now run [http://www.meetup.com/TBD](http://www.meetup.com/TBD).

* We will make out best effort to let know as many people as we can that meetup has moved. Please help us spread the word!

* Check out what our [initiatives](initiatives) are, chip in or propose yours!

* Come and say hi in next meetup, or even better, submit a talk! 

Thanks,
<br>Katrin and Sean</br>
