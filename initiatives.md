<li> 5 reasons why Scala. Which one is your favorite? </li>

<p>Let's talk about why learning another syntax (<i>sigh</i>) is sometimes justified. Listen to our reasons and share yours aka why you're here.</p>

<!--[Statically typed, Immutable, Functional, Object Oriented, Fully Interopable with Java.]-->

<li> How Scala syntax makes you stronger? (survival is assumed ...) </li>

<p>Let's present the fundamentals (not basics) of Scala syntax - the things that recruited us as many others to be part of the functional (programming) movement.</p>

<li> Java: anything that a while-loop can do, can also be done in a for-loop! Scala: who cares? </li>

<p>Let's explore Scala collections: for fun and profit. It is so rich that we won't be able to cover it all in one session, but we can make you crave for more!</p>

<li> Scala Pattern Matching: you have to see to believe! </li>

<p>Warm up questions: Can 'switch' statement be applied to strings in Java? How about C++?</p>
<p>It was easy? Good! How about that one: how can one use 'if' and stay immutable? </p>
<p>The last but not the least: why those questions were relevant to the topic mentioned?</p>

<li> Checking for null and throwing exceptions - it's so 90's ;)</li>

<p>If every time writing if(null == ...) you thought there must be a better way, you were right! Let's talk how Scala avoids nulls and treats exceptions and why it is safer than checking nulls everywhere.</p>
