<p style="margin:0">We welcome two kinds of talk proposals.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Primary</b>: A meetup will usually have two primary talks or one primary and several community talks.  Talks that take over 30 minutes are generally considered a primary.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Community</b>: Community talks are a great way for you to give back to the local Scala community. They can be 5 to 15 minutes and there will be some time for questions at the end.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A success (or failure) of using Scala.</li>
<li>A library you’ve created or used that you want to showcase.</li>
<li>Elaboration of a Scala language feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<p style="margin:0">We want to keep the options for talks as open as possible.  Don’t be shy and share your unique idea to use this time with us.  If you've never given a talk before we recommend doing a community talk first.  This is a low commitment stepping stone for you to try your hand at public speaking about technology!</p>
